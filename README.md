# File-Directory_system
Directory Management system using basic concepts of DSA with C++ <br>
The File Management System is a C++ program that simulates basic file and folder management operations on two virtual drives, C: and D:.<br>
It allows users to perform operations such as adding and deleting folders and files, and displaying the folder and file structure of the drives.<br>
# How it Works
The system uses two linked lists for each drive:<br>

The outer linked list represents folders.<br>
The inner linked list represents files within each folder.<br>
The main menu provides options for the user to interact with the drives and perform actions on folders and files.<br>

Operations include:<br>

Displaying folder and file lists.<br>
Adding or deleting folders and files.<br>
Navigating through the folder structure.<br>
